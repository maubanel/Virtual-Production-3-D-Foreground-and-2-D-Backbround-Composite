## Setup

1. Make sure that you are running the project on Windows 10.  The plug-ins are not mac compatible at this moment.  Your PC should have 16 gigs of RAM as this work is very power hungry.  It is recommended that you have a good gaming video card and that you plug-in your laptop as this work uses most of your available processing power.
