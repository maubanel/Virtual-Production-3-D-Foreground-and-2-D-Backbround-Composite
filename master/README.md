## Add Master Sequence and Create First Edit

1.  Now we can include multiple sequences inside a master sequence.  So we can edit different sequences together.  Go to **Scenes** and add a **Animation | Level Sequence**.  Call it `MasterSequence`.  Press the **+ Track** and add a **Shot Track**.

2.  Now put the scrub bar at **Frame** `0` and select **Scene0010** as the first cut.

3.  Now I will be cutting at around frame **150** away to shot 2.  I looked at the footage and this seems like a logical spot.  So I will trim the clip to 150 frames.
