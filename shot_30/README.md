## Third and Fourth Cut

1.  You should know enough about the process by now to complete the third and fourth cut.  You will import the third set of plates, create a new **Media Image Sequence** for the background and the lens distortion.  Add the animation into the scene and import the motions capture.  Drag the camera from the **World Outliner** and import the 3rd camera track to match the last camera. You will notice that the mannequin moves in front of the pillar and the chairs and should be behind them.

2. You will need to import a **Matte** layer into the sequence and the composite for shot three.  Create a new **Media Image Sequeqnce** and call it **Shot0030Matte**.  Add another **Media Layer** to the **Shot0030Sequence**.  Create a new **Media | Media** texture.
