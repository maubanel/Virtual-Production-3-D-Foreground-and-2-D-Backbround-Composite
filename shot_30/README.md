## Third and Fourth Cut

1.  You should know enough about the process by now to complete the third and fourth cut.  You will import the third set of plates, create a new **Media Image Sequence** for the background and the lens distortion.  Add the animation into the scene and import the motions capture.  Drag the camera from the **World Outliner** and import the 3rd camera track to match the last camera.
