## Add Master & Second Sequence

1.  Create a new folder inside **Plates** called `Scene0020`.  Right click and select **Show in Explorer**.  We will be importing the new plates **WITHOUT** going through the import process.

![import new files into new scene0020 folder](../images/showInExplorerSc2.jpg)

2.  Drag the **footage** folder from the student folder to import the **EXR** files for the background plate and lens distortion.  Make sure you ignore the import message and press **DON'T IMPORT** when it pops up in the bottom right.

3. Now you should see the **plates** and **distortion** folder with no files showing up in Unreal (this is ok).

4.  Lets add a **Scenes | Scene0020** folder and add two **Media | Image Media Source** actors.  Call one `Scene0020Source` and the other `Scene0020Distortion`.
