## Add Master & Second Sequence

1.  Create a new folder inside **Plates** called `Scene0020`.  Right click and select **Show in Explorer**.  We will be importing the new plates **WITHOUT** going through the import process.

![import new files into new scene0020 folder(../images/showInExplorerSc2.jpg)

***

2.  Drag the two folders from the student folder to import the **EXR** files.  Make sure you ignore the import message and press **DO NOT IMPORT** when it pops up in the bottom right.

![import scene two plates](../images/.jpg)

***

3. Now you should see the **plates** and **distortion** folder with no files showing up in Unreal (this is ok).

![add camera cut track](../images/distortionPlateFolder.jpg)
