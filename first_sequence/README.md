## First Level Sequence

1.  Normally we would use a **Media Player** actor to play the video.  Since we are not using a game engine to play a cut scene we will be just using it to play back a scene.  In UE4 it is called **Sequencer**.  This allows us to play back a clip without the media player object.  Go to the **Scenes | Scene0010** folder and click on the **Add/Import | Animation | Level Sequence** element.
