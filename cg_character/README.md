## Add CG Character

1.  We will use the UE4 supplied mannequin to our game.  To do this we will have to migrate it from another project.  Press **File | Save All** and run the **Epic Launcher** again.  Create a new project and this time select the **Game Type**.  Then select **Third Person** template as this will contain the player mannequin.
