## Importing EXR Sequence 

1.  First lets get started by creating a composite.  Think of this as like a **After Effects** project where the 2-D compositing will take place. Select the **Composure** tab at the bottom.  If this does not show up go up to **Window | Composure Compositing**.  If this does not show up you do not have the plug-in installed. **Right Mouse Click** in the empty area in the tab and select **Create New Comp**.

2.  Select an empty composite by pressing the **Empty Comp Shot** button.

3. Rename this layer **Patio Comp**.

4.  Right click on the **PatioComp** name and select **Add Comp Layer**.

5. Now we will be adding the background film plate that was shot in camera.  Press the "Add Material Plate** button.

6. Now it looks like nothing happened.  In the Unreal editor a lot is hidden inside these little arrows that expand.  Press the **Arrow** next to the name of the comp and you will see the media plate.  Rename it to `BackgroundPlate`.
