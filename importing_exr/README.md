## Importing EXR Sequence 

1.  First lets get started by creating a composite.  Think of this as like a **After Effects** project where the 2-D compositing will take place. Select the **Composure** tab at the bottom.  If this does not show up go up to **Window | Composure Compositing**.  If this does not show up you do not have the plug-in installed. **Right Mouse Click** in the empty area in the tab and select **Create New Comp**.
